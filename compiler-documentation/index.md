# The *juice* Programming Language Compiler Documentation

The compiler documentation will eventually contain some information about the inner workings of the *juice* compiler. For example, you'll find an overview over the compiler pipeline and some more specific documents like a short description of how the type-checker works.  
However, since there is still a lot of progress to be made before the compiler will be anywhere near production ready, this section of the documentation will remain empty for now.
