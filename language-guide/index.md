# The *juice* Programming Language Guide

In the future, the language guide will provide a simple and easy to follow intro for people new to the *juice* programming language. It will give a quick overview over most important programming concepts and how they are handled in *juice*.  
For now, this part of the documentation remains empty, but it will become a high priority as soon as the language reaches a somewhat usable state.
